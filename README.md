# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

This is my personal configuration, there you can see my key bindings and the rest of default.

My knowledge of .lua is about zero, so the config is probably not ideal. But it works for me.
Advice from savvy people is welcome.

> It's very important, I'm using unusual movement key bindings

## This is my personal bindings

### Movement

1. `j`, `k`, `l`, `;` as left, down, up, right accordingly instead of `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` (it works in most of required plugins, but not everywhere)
2. `n` as jump to start of previous word instead of `b`
3. `b` and `B` as navigate to next/previous in search mode instead of `n` and `N`
4. `<leader>j`, `<leader>k`, `<leader>l`, `<leader>;` to move between splits
5. `<A-j>` and `<A-;>` to move to left and right buffers accordingly
6. `<leader>w` as split to right
7. `N` as go to definition, I don't know default binding for it
8. `<C-k>`, `<C-l>` to browse in blink.cmp floating window and `<C-y>` (which is default, but another keys are disabled) to select completion
9. `<A-j>`, `<A-;>` for moving between snippet control points

### Code actions and editing including plugins

1. `<C-j>` as delete char before cursor in insert mode instead of `<C-h>`, but `<C-h>` is still working
2. `<C-s>` as save file
3. `h` as hover tooltip, `K` is still working
4. `<leader>e` toggle Neo-tree
5. `<leader>rn` to IncRename as floating window
6. `<leader>sa` to mini.surround (visual only)
7. `S` for flash plugin
8. `<A-k>`, `<A-l>` move selected text up and down accordingly (visual)

2. `e` move to end of word
3. `0` move to start of the line
4. `$` move to end of the line

6. `<C-y>`, `<C-e>` slowly move page up and down accordingly without moving cursor
